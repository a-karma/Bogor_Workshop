# Applications of Genomics in Wildlife Conservation
please do not modify these first two lines of the .md file
This is the last workshop day
use the same syntax to add pictures:

placeholder name within square brackets and ../IM/file_name.png within parentheses

## Session Title
please add a few sentences here to introduce your session of the tutorial.

### Example of section title 
##### Example of sub-section title 
- this is how you define bullet point
- in case you want to make more explicit 
- the series of steps required to accomplish a task 

See example below on how to format commands that the participants will have to run

```sh
conda activate Day_1
plink --bfile file_name --recode
```

you can instead use `this syntax` to highlight an in-line command, software name or something you think it's important

see below the syntax for tables:

| column A | column B |
| ------ | ------ |
| row 1a | row 1b |
| row 2a | row 2b |
| you can also leave cells blank | |

you can also use this env for exercises and tips:
> Exercise 1 
> 
> Modify the command above to ...

Or even:
> Best practice: never use spaces in file names

note the empty line in the first quoted env (it seems to make it look nicer on github)
