# Applications of Genomics in Wildlife Conservation

## Day 5 - Modelling gene flow 
In this session we will use f-statistics to formally test 

### Introduction




##### Example of sub-section title 
- this is how you define bullet point
- in case you want to make more explicit 
- the series of steps required to accomplish a task 

See example below on how to format commands that the participants will have to run

```sh
conda activate Day_1
plink --bfile file_name --recode
```

you can instead use `this syntax` to highlight an in-line command, software name or something you think it's important

see below the syntax for tables:

| column A | column B |
| ------ | ------ |
| row 1a | row 1b |
| row 2a | row 2b |
| you can also leave cells blank | |

you can also use this env for exercises and tips:
> Exercise 1 
> 
> Modify the command above to ...

Or even:
> Best practice: never use spaces in file names

note the empty line in the first quoted env (it seems to make it look nicer on github)
