## Day 5 - An interactive case study - Session 2
This session is an “interactive case study” – we will try to see if we can interpret some advanced population genetic analyses! And hopefully see some interesting research.

Below you will find some questions and some images/plots to help you answer the questions. In parallel, we will be showing slides that introduce the background and explain what you see on the plots. For each question, you will get 5-10 minutes to discuss in pairs or small groups. After that, we will discuss the questions for 5-10 minutes in plenum. We hope you will not be shy about offering your opinion during the discussion!

If there is not enough time, e.g. if we get absorbed in some really interesting discussions along the way, don't fear. You can try to see if you can answer the remaining questions on your own time.

### Discussion questions 
Please follow the slide show which will tell you when to discuss/answer the different questions. For each question, there will first be a plot, followed by the question for discussion.

#### Demographic history and genetic diversity
Cattle and banteng heterozygosity           |  Cattle and Bali cattle PSMC                |
