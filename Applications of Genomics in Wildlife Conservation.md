# Applications of Genomics in Wildlife Conservation
Generating and analysing genome wide information from endangered populations can greatly assist population management. 
Manipulating genomic data, obtained from next-generation sequencing platforms, however, requires a set of skills in bioinformatics that often prove to be a major barrier. In this workshop you will learn  in next-generation sequencing data analysis for conservation
