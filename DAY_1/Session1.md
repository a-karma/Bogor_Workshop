# Applications of Genomics in Wildlife Conservation

## Day 1 - Session 1 - Basic concepts of command line programming

### 1. Working from terminal and remote servers
In this section, we will outline the procedure for connecting to our cloud server and provide you with some essential preliminary definitions. 

- `OS` (short for Operating System) is the program that manages all other applications in a computer. Windows, Linux and macOS are all examples of Operating Systems. Users can interact directly with the operating system through a user interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical UI (GUI).
- `terminal` 
- `shell`
- `file system`
- `script`

In the guide we've sent you, you've seen how to install putty (Windows users) or how to connect from terminal 

### 2. The filesystem 
This section outlines the basic commands for navigating file systems and creating a structured directory hierarchy for research projects. The naming of files and directories is more crucial than you might realize; a clear and consistent structure will significantly streamline your workflow, especially when dealing with complex projects and pipelines. While you can adapt and customize this template structure to your specific needs, adhering to these principles will greatly enhance project organization and accessibility.

We will start with creating a parent directory for our project. 
```sh
mkdir project_bash
cd project_bash
```
The first command (`mkdir`) creates the required folder while the `cd` command is used to move from your home directory to the new directory. Now we need to create one directory where we are going to store our scripts, one for the raw data, and one for our results:

```sh
mkdir scripts; mkdir raw_data; mkdir results
```
note the use of the semicolon (;) to separate different commands on the same line.
> `Tip`: never use white spaces when naming files or directories

Then, we need to create a separate directory for each stage of our pipeline/analysis. Because of my lack of immagination, each directory will be termed as `Stage` and we are going to number them sequentially but I would encourage you to use a better naming
convention when it comes to your research. Given that typing the same command over and over is tedious, we are going to use one of the basics building blocks of any programming language: a loop.  

```sh
for i in $(seq 3)
do
mkdir stage_$i
done
```
Let's unpack this:

The `for` loop is a fundamental programming construct that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met. In this particular instance, the loop iterates over the values generated by the seq command. 

The `seq` command produces a sequence of integers, and in this case, it generates the numbers from 1 to 3.

The `do` command marks the beginning of the block of code that will be executed repeatedly for each value of the iterator variable

The variable `i` serves as the iterator, keeping track of the current position in the sequence. With each iteration, the value of `i` changes to the next number in the sequence, until it reaches the end of the sequence.

The `mkdir`command: Creates a directory each time (3 directories in total). 

The `done` command marks the end of the for loop, indicating that the loop should continue executing the enclosed block of code until the entire sequence of values has been processed.

This will create 3 directories called: `stage_1`, `stage_2`, `stage_3`.

Now type:

```ls```

To ensure the directories have been indeed created.

Maintaining a detailed record of executed commands is an essential practice for reproducibility and debugging purposes. By keeping a log of your actions, you can easily retrace your steps, identify potential errors, and effectively reproduce your work, even after a significant time gap.

To facilitate efficient command logging, it's recommended to adopt a consistent naming convention for your log files. In this case, we'll use the file name "What_I_did.txt" to store our command history. To create this empty log file, simply utilize the touch command:

```touch What_I_did.txt```

For our purpose today we will create a simple directory structure for our research project. Each of our `stage` directories should contain three items:
- a What_I_Did.txt file.
- an output sub-directory
- a sub-directory called input

In principles, you could navigate to the each stage directory using the `cd` command and create these objects manually but that involves a lot of typing. You should instead use a loop to avoid this tedious task. An efficient way to do this from a shell terminal requires to create a list of parent directories and then create the child directories only where we need them.
```sh
ls -d stage* > dir_list.txt
```
Note the use of the `>`. This symbol in bash has a special meaning: redirect the output of the command that precedes it to a file.

Now that we have the list, we can easily implement another type of loop using the reserved word `while`:
```sh
while read -r line
do
touch $line/What_I_Did.txt
done < dir_list.txt
```

The `$` sign preceding the variable named `line` is crucial in this context because it indicates that we are referencing the actual value stored in the variable, rather than the variable name itself. During each iteration of the loop, the read command reads a line from the `dir_list.txt` file and assigns it to the `$line` variable.

> `Exercise 1`
>
> use a similar while loop to create a sub-directory called `output` inside each stage directory

In data processing pipelines, where the output of one step becomes the input for the next, it's often necessary to transfer data between directories. However, blindly copying files can lead to inefficient storage usage and unnecessary data duplication. A more effective approach is to utilize symbolic links, which provide a pointer to the original data rather than creating a new copy.

Consider the scenario where `stage_1/output` and `stage_1/input` contain identical data. Copying the entire contents from `stage_1/output` to `stage_1/input` would result in redundant storage of the same data, consuming unnecessary disk space.

Symbolic links offer a solution to this issue. Instead of replicating the data, a symbolic link is created in `stage_1/input`, pointing to the original data in `stage_1/output`. This link acts as a shortcut, directing the system to the actual data location whenever the input directory is accessed.

Here is an example of symbolic links:

```sh
ln -s ~/project_bash/raw_data/ ~/project_bash/stage_1/input
```
The `ln` command stands for ”link” and it has this general syntax:
```sh
ln full/path/to/source full/path/to/destination/link_name
```
Here we have used the `-s` flag to specify a symbolic link between the `raw_data` directory and a new `input` folder (link name) inside the `stage_1 directory`. This means that the content of `raw_data` is now accessible from `stage_1/input`. Let’s double-check:
```sh
touch raw_data/input_zero.txt
ls stage_1
ls stage_1/input
ls raw_data
```
The first command is just to pupulate the `raw_data` folder with a file (`input_zero.txt`). By running the second command you should see that an `input` folder has been created via the `ln` command. Now the `stage_1` directory contains all three elements required. The output of the third and fourth commands should be just `input_zero.txt`.

> `Exercise 2`
>
> Use the ln command to complete our file system structure
> by linking each `stage_{i}/output` to an input folder inside the `stage_{i+1}` directory.
> Note that in our example stage 4 is actually termed Results.

If you have made a mistake with links, do not panic. You can alwayse remove them with `rm` or with the `unlink` command.

Now that we have a good structure we can start populating our directories. Let's create some files in the `project_bash` directory.

```sh
for i in $(seq 3)
do
touch output_file_$1
done
```
Now we should move each of these file to the corresponding `stage_{i}/Output` directory.

> `Exercise 3`
>
> Use a for foop to move each of the output_file_{i} ∀i ∈ {1, 2, 3} to its own directory.
> 
> To do so, you should use the `mv` command which has the following syntax: `mv target_file_name path/to/destination`.


If you now run the `tree` command from the Project_BASH directory, you should get:

### 3. Regular expressions & file manipulations
In this section we are going to apply what we already know about variables, conditional and loops to explore text files. 
We will mostly focus on file manipulation using regular expressions, using `grep`, `sed` and `awk`.

Regular expressions, also known as regex or regexp, are a powerful tool for manipulating text. They allow you to search for, extract, and modify patterns in text data. In Bash scripting, regular expressions are particularly useful for processing text files and automating tasks that involve text manipulation.

Let’s start with opening a new terminal, connecting to the VM and look at the file called `random.fasta`:
```sh
cd /home/Data/Day_1/
less random.fasta
Press Q to exit.
```

As the name suggests, this file contains some random DNA sequences of different length stored in a fasta format (a very common format DNA analysis).

As you can see, each entry consists of two lines: a header (with the sequence identifier) and a second line containing the actual sequence.
Lets calculate how many lines are in this fasta file:
```sh
wc -l random.fasta
```
This gives us the total number of lines. Divide this number by two and you'll get the number of sequences.

Now, let’s look at the first 7 sequences which correspond to the first 14 lines of the file.
We can easily print them on screen using:
```sh
head -14 random.fasta
```
The `head` command is a fundamental tool in Bash scripting used to display the first portion of a file's contents. It's commonly used to quickly preview the beginning of a file or check for specific information at the start.

If instead we were interested in the last 4 entries, we would use:
```sh
tail -8 random.fasta
```
The tail command is a versatile tool in Bash scripting used to display the last portion of a file's contents. It's commonly used to quickly review the end of a file, check for recent changes, or monitor log files in real time.

We could a combination of these two commands to extract set of sequence in the middle of the file:
```sh
head -20 random.fasta | tail -4
```
With the last command we have selected the 9th and 10th entries corresponding to the lines from 17 to 20 in our fasta file.
The vertical bar (`|`) is called `pipe` and it is used to connect the two commands (`head` and `tail` in this case). 
Specifically, it redirects the standard output of the first command which then serves as input for the second command.

Standard output, also known as stdout, is the default output stream of a process in a Unix-like operating system. It is the channel through which a process (here `head`) sends its output to another process (here `tail`).

Piping the output of head into tail or vice versa is a simple way to extract a block of lines but it becomes very slow if the file you are dealing with is huge. An alternative is using `sed`. 

`sed` is a stream editor, a powerful tool for manipulating text data. It allows you to search, replace, insert, and delete text within files or data streams. sed is commonly used in Bash scripting for tasks like processing log files, cleaning up text files, and performing text-based transformations.

Let’s consider the following commands:

```sh
sed -n '9,12p' random.fasta
sed -n '9,+3p' random.fasta
```
These are alternative ways of printing a range of lines. In this case we are printing lines from 9 to 12 which of course correspond to our 5th and 6th entry.

It is unlikely though that we will know in advance the line numbers of the entries that are relevant to our analysis. Most of the time will have to parse the file and look for patterns. That’s when regular expressions (`regex`) become very useful.

As you may have noticed, all header lines in random.fasta start with `>seq` followed by a number, `Hg`, and a letter, separated by underscores. The string `Hg` stands for haplogroup (A,B,or C) and we might be interested in knowing how many reads we have for each group. We can calculate this using `grep`.

`grep` is a powerful tool for searching for patterns in text files. It is commonly used in Bash scripting to locate specific text strings, analyze log files, and perform text-based searches.

Let's consider the following command:

```sh
grep '>seq.*_Hg_A' random.fasta | wc -l
```
Let's unpack this command:

`grep` stands for "global regular expression print" and it has the following syntax
```sh
grep 'regex' target_file
```
In our example the regex or the pattern that we are looking is obviously `>seq.*_Hg_A`. 
This regular expression is designed not to match a unique sequence of character but rather a series of sequences that are similar to each another.
In fact, this regex will match any line containing the string `>seq` followed by any character (represented by the `.` symbol) that appears zero or more times (`*`), 
followed by the string `_Hg_A`. Thus, `grep` will print all the header lines in the random.fasta corresponding to haplogroup A and this output is the piped (|) 
into the command `wc -l` which simply counts the number of matching lines.

> `Exercise 4`
>
> Find out how many sequences we have for each group by modifying the pattern of the grep command above.

We can also use regex inside a sed command. For example, let's extract the 3rd sequence of each haplogroup:
```sh
sed -n '/seq_3_/,+1p' random.fasta > /home/your-user-id/Project_BASH/Raw_Data/third_seq_all_Hg.fasta
```
As you can see, it looks very similar to the sed command we used before with the exception that instead of providing sed with specific line number, 
here we have specified a pattern (`/seq_3_/`) and asked the program to print eachh matching line plus and the following one: (+1p). 
Finally, we have redirected the output to store this information into a file called third_seq_all_Hg.fasta.

> `Exercise 5`
> 
> Now navigate to your `Raw_Data` directory and visualise the content of the file on screen using the command `cat name-of-the-file`.

Let’s have a look at a different file format and keep on experimenting with regex. 
In the`/home/Data/Day_1` folder you should see a file called `dog_genes.gtf` 
which is a tab separated file containing annotations for some coding sequences in the dog genome.
We can have a look at the header (lines starting with #) by running:
```sh
grep '^#' /home/Data/Day_1/dog_genes.gtf
```
> `Exercise 6`
>
> Create an headerless version of this file using the ”select non matching lines” option of grep (-v flag)
> and redirect the output to a file called `dog_genes_no_H.tsv` inside the Stage_1/output directory.

The first line of your headerless file should be as follows:
`X ensembl gene 1575 5716 . + . gene_id "ENSCAFG00000010935"; gene_version "3"; gene_source "ensembl"; gene_biotype "protein_coding"`
It contains a lot of information that is not relevant for us at the moment. 
The fields that we are interested in are:
- The chromosome (X: 1st field)
- The type of the feature (gene: 3rd field)
- The starting position of the feature (1575: 4th field)
- The ending position of the feature (5716: 5th field)

> `Exercise 7`
> 
> Use `cut` to extract the required fields from dog_genes_no_H.tsv.
> Then redirect the output to a file called `dog_genes_table.tsv` inside your `Stage_2/Output/` directory.
> See cut --help to identify the option for fields

Now that we have extracted the relevant information, we would like to make a few adjust-
ments to our table. Let’s start with adding a string at the beginning of each line:
```sh
cd Stage_2/Output/
sed -i 's/^/chr_/' dog_genes_table.tsv
```
Here we have used the substitution command of sed (`s`) and modified the file in-place (`i`).
The substitution command has the following syntax:
```sh
sed 's/target/replacement/'
```
In our example, the caret symbol (^) denotes the beginning of a line and 
we replaced this with `chr_`. You can check whether the substitution
worked or not by examining the first 10 lines of the table with head.

The next thing we would like to do is switching the order of the columns in our table:
- 1. Chromosome
- 2. Starting Position
- 3. Ending Position
- 4. Feature Type
This requires a simple awk command:
```sh
awk 'BEGIN {OFS="\t"};{print $1,$3,$4,$2}' Stage_2/Output/dog_genes_table.tsv > Stage_3/Output/d_g_tab_cfp.tsv
```

The OFS option before the print command stands for ”Output Filed Separator” and we set
it to Tab (`\t`) to ensure our table has the correct delimiter for a ”tab separated file” (TSV).
`awk` stores each field in a different variable which is accessible via the `$` symbol. 
We made use of this feature to put the columns in the rigth order.

We are almost done with pre-processing our data but there’s still something that’s not
quite right with it. Have a look at the first column:
```sh
cd Stage_3/Output
cat d_g_tab_cfp.tsv | cut -f 1
```
Have you noticed that the chromosomes are not in the right order? Let’s fix it!
```sh
sort -V -o ../../Results/d_g_sorted_table.bed d_g_tab_cfp.tsv
```

Here we used the -V option because we are dealing with a mixture of numerical and string
data. Note also the -o to specify the output file which must precede the input.
Our table is now ready to be analysed. Hurray!!!
