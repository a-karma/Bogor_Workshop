# Applications of Genomics in Wildlife Conservation
## Day 1 - Basic concepts of command line programming - Session 2

### 1. Shell Scripting



### 2. conda
In Session 1 we have seen three examples of text file that are commonly used in bioinformatics:

- `fasta`
- `GTF`
- `BED`


You can read more about conda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

```sh
conda activate Day_1
plink --bfile file_name --recode
```

### 3. Transferring files
see below the syntax for tables:

| column A | column B |
| ------ | ------ |
| row 1a | row 1b |
| row 2a | row 2b |
| you can also leave cells blank | |

you can also use this env for exercises and tips:
> Exercise 1 
> 
> Modify the command above to ...

Or even:
> Best practice: never use spaces in file names

note the empty line in the first quoted env (it seems to make it look nicer on github)
